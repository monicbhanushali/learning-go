# Learning Go Programming language

## Fundamentals

 - package == project == workspace
 - `func main()` - creates an executable code while anything apart from that creates packages which can be imported into other code, just like npm packages
 - go is a static type language just like java, c++

## variable naming/convention

```go
// Variable declaration convention - with explicity typing
var name string = "Hey I am a variable"

// Variable declaration - without explicit typing. Go infers the type from the right hand side value
// operator ":=" is only used when declaring new variables and shouldn't or can't be used for re-assigning the values
name := "Hey I am variable whose type is inferred"

// Variable value re-assignment
name = "My name changed.... :/"

```

## Built in data types
